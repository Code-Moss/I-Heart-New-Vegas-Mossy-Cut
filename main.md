[**Honest Hearts Workbench Crate Luck**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62415)  
Forces the Honest Hearts workbench crates (the only source of skill books in the Honest Hearts DLC) to obey the player character's Luck as opposed to generating random loot. The lone bottle of Nuka-Cola Quantum now also obey's the player character's Luck.

[**Tesla Cannon Chaining**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65711)  
Upgrades the Tesla Cannon so that it can now actually chain between targets, as it was suggested from the game files but which doesn't actually happen the way it would have been intended in Broken Steel. The Tesla Beaton Prototype is turned into a continuous beam attack weapon.

### FNVEdit instructions

The following mods have conflict issues that need to be addressed, or otherwise aspects we want to see tweaked. It's possible you haven't installed all of them, so simply skip the corresponding instructions.

To make these edits, you will have to launch **FNVEdit** through Mod Organizer 2. Under each spoiler you will find:

- The **plugins** that need to be loaded. This can be one, when it comes to editing a single plugin, or more, when it comes to forwarding changes from one mod to another. Forwarding a change means applying the same change to a mod that sits later in the load order. We will always apply the change to the plugin corresponding to the mod we are trying to fix. This will always be the plugin listed *last* under each spoiler.
- The **instructions** to follow, and the **record** which those instructions have to be applied to. To search for a given record, copy the record ID (which you will find in **bold** at the end of the instructions) and paste it into FNVEdit's **FormID filter** (the empty box labeled **FormID** after you've loaded your plugins in FNVEdit), and then press Enter. This will search for that given record.

Once you've made your edits, you need to exit FNVEdit, and **Save** your changes when prompted.
