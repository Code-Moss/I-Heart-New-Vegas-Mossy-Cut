# DISCLAIMER

The guide presented here is an extension to the [**Main**](https://github.com/Sigourn/iheartnewvegas/blob/master/main.md) Left My Heart In New Vegas guide. It includes optional mods that are not present in **Main** for the sake of streamlining. Feel free to follow this guide in parallel to the main document, or, if you wish, follow it after finishing the main document. The correct mod order and load order, as well as slightly different **Finishing touches** instructions will be found at the end of this guide.

# LEFT MY HEART IN NEW VEGAS ADDENDUM

## PATCHES

[**Ammo Burst Case Count Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69175)  
Fixes the game only giving you one ammo case when your weapon uses more than one ammo count in a shot, for you and companions.

[**Ammo Script Fixes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/63997)  
Fixes several problems at the core level with how ammo scripts and effects work. Includes other gameplay tweaks.

[**Crippled Limb Reaction Enforcer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73147)  
Makes the idle animations for crippled limbs come through in situations where the game cannot pick them correctly like when the damage comes from an explosion. Includes other gameplay tweaks.

[**Critical and Effects - Fixes and Tweaks**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69200)  
Fixes the damage dealing critical effects of most vanilla weapons so that they cannot cause you to miss "killcounts" and other proc effects such as crime responsibility. Includes other gameplay tweaks.

[**Gauss Rifle VATS Fix - JIP**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69136)  
Fixes the Gauss Rifle not dealing headshots or critical damage in VATS.

[**Meltdown NVSE Upgrade**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65718?)  
Overhauls the Meltdown perk to bring its workings under control and actually work as described. Includes configurable options for its Rampage feature, which increases your critical hit chance at every chained Meltdown, as well as the companion Meltdown feature, among other tweaks.

> ℹ️ I personally suggest disabling both of these features using the mod's ini, but your mileage may vary.

[**Miss Fortune NVSE Upgrade**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64709?)  
Makes Miss Fortune's wacky effects more consistent. It will avoid affecting non-hostile targets, can now recognize and detonate all kinds of weapons, but won't detonate them near the player or companions. 

[**Mostly Unarmed Tweaks**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69283)  
Fixes the fatigue-dealing weapons to deal correct and damage-adjusted fatigue. Includes other gameplay tweaks.

[**Universal Pyromaniac Buff for Fire Effects**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71505)  
Makes the Pyromaniac perk affect all the lingering fire damage effects from weapons and ammo.

[**Well Rested Overhaul**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64628)  
Expands how the Well Rested effect works. Effect duration is now in actual game hours, gives a few more buffs aside from increased XP, and patches all the game prostitutes' scripts to also grant the buff for purchasing their services.

## FINISHING TOUCHES

### Mod order and load order

[**Left My Heart In New Vegas Modlist and Loadorder**](https://github.com/Sigourn/iheartnewvegasrepository/blob/main/Left%20My%20Heart%20In%20New%20Vegas%20Modlist%20and%20Loadorder.7z)  
Adjusts mod order and load order for Left My Heart In New Vegas to work as intended.
- Extract the files into **C:\Games\Fallout New Vegas Mods\MO2\profiles\Left My Heart In New Vegas**, overwriting when prompted.

> ℹ️ Mod order dictates the priority a given mod's assets have over the mods installed before it. This is handled by **modlist.txt**.
 
> ℹ️ Load order dictates the priority a given mod's plugins have over the mods' plugins loaded before them. This is handled by **loadorder.txt**.

### Generating LOD

> ⚠️ Assuming you use a different mod setup than the one recommended in the guide, you will have to generate LOD yourself.

- Run **FNVLODGen** in MO2.
- Right click on the list of worldspaces, and click **Select All**. Uncheck **FreesideFortWorld "Old Mormon Fort"**.
- Click **Generate**. The process will take some time.
- After the **LOD Generator: finished (you can close this application now)** message appears, close the program.

> ⚠️ Having too many LOD mods installed can cause **FNVLODGen** to fail at generating LOD appropriately. At the moment, the only scenario where I've found this to happen is at the Old Mormon Fort. Hence why are generating its LOD separate from the rest of the worldspaces.

- Now disable the following mods:
  - **LOD Additions and Improvements**
  - **LOD Additions and Improvements YUP Patch**
  - **FNV LOD Supplementation**
  - **TCM's LOD Overhaul**
  - **Much Needed LOD**
  - **Much Needed LOD YUP Patch**
- Run **FNVLODGen** in MO2.
- Right click on the list of worldspaces, and click **Select None**. Check **FreesideFortWorld "Old Mormon Fort"**.
- Click **Generate**. The process will take some time.
- After the **LOD Generator: finished (you can close this application now)** message appears, close the program.

> ⚠️ Remember to re-enable the disabled LOD mods.

Now all that's left is to install our generated LOD.

- Navigate to your **Fallout New Vegas Mods\FNVLODGen Output** folder, and make an archive out of the **textures** and **meshes** folder. Name it **FNVLODGen Output**.
- Install **FNVLODGen Output** with MO2.
