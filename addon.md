# DISCLAIMER

The guide presented here is an extension to the [**Main**](https://github.com/Sigourn/iheartnewvegas/blob/master/main.md) Left My Heart In New Vegas guide. It includes optional mods that are not present in **Main** for the sake of streamlining. Feel free to follow this guide in parallel to the main document, or, if you wish, follow it after finishing the main document. The correct mod order and load order, as well as slightly different **Finishing touches** instructions will be found at the end of this guide.

# LEFT MY HEART IN NEW VEGAS ADD-ON

## PATCHES ADD-ON

### Non-purist NVSE bug fixes

[**Ammo Burst Case Count Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69175)  
Fixes the game only giving you one ammo case when your weapon uses more than one ammo count in a shot, for you and companions.

[**Ammo Script Fixes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/63997)  
Fixes several problems at the core level with how ammo scripts and effects work. Includes other gameplay tweaks.

[**Crippled Limb Reaction Enforcer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73147)  
Makes the idle animations for crippled limbs come through in situations where the game cannot pick them correctly like when the damage comes from an explosion. Includes other gameplay tweaks.

[**Critical and Effects - Fixes and Tweaks**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69200)  
Fixes the damage dealing critical effects of most vanilla weapons so that they cannot cause you to miss "killcounts" and other proc effects such as crime responsibility. Includes other gameplay tweaks.

[**Gauss Rifle VATS Fix - JIP**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69136)  
Fixes the Gauss Rifle not dealing headshots or critical damage in VATS.

[**Mostly Unarmed Tweaks**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69283)  
Fixes the fatigue-dealing weapons to deal correct and damage-adjusted fatigue. Includes other gameplay tweaks.

[**Universal Pyromaniac Buff for Fire Effects**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71505)  
Makes the Pyromaniac perk affect all the lingering fire damage effects from weapons and ammo.

## GAMEPLAY QOL

[**Better Bleed Me Dry**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67959)  
Makes Bleed Me Dry work like most other New Vegas' quests, allowing you to collect the relevant quest items without waiting for the quest stages to trigger.

[**Honest Hearts Skill Books Redistributed**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/74526)  
Replaces the randomly generated skill books system by distributing one of each skill book across Zion Valley.

[**Hunting Revolver Iron Sights**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73124)  
Removes the Hunting Revolver's scope and makes it a separate weapon mod.

Files to install:
- **Hunting Revolver Iron Sights** (Main files)

[**Stars Turned Face Up**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/70419/)  
Turns all Sunset Sarsaparilla Star bottle caps face up, making it easier to spot them.

## GAMEPLAY

[**B42 Melee Bash**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/68055)  
Adds melee attacks for non-melee weapons.

[**Enhanced Vision**](https://eddoursul.win/mods/enhanced-vision/)  
Power Armor helmets and other high-tech gear now enable enhanced vision modes like Night Vision, Heat Vision and EM Vision. If there’s no Power Armor equipped as a power source, energy cells are required while these modes are active. Upgrades for other kinds of helmets and eyeglasses can be purchased through the MCM panel.

[**Realistic Movement**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64202/)  
Movement is slowed for all actors, and their turning speed is also reduced, forcing them to make parabolic turns instead of sharp ones. Movement speed is especially slower for actors who have their weapon out. This makes combat targets less likely to dodge your bullets while strafing. The slowed movement speed and slower turning speed also makes enemies less likely to bolt out suddenly from around a corner in a jerky way.

[**Snowglobe Tweaks Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67466)  
Makes it so you need to first discover the snow globe display in the Lucky 38 Presidential Suite, then ask Jane in the Penthouse about the snow globe collection. Only then will you be able to sell snow globes. DLCs snow globes now need to be sold to Jane, they won't disappear out of thin air anymore (the Dead Money snow globe now reward 2000 caps instead of 2000 Sierra Madre chips).

[**Standardized NCR Supply Caches**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/74145)  
Swaps out the current, barely-useful supply cache loot table with a static one, that will contain better items as you level up.

Files to install:
- **Patchy's Preferred Preparedness Package - Scaler Moon Edition** (Main files)

[**Well Rested Overhaul**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64628)  
Expands how the Well Rested effect works. Effect duration is now in actual game hours, gives a few more buffs aside from increased XP, and patches all the game prostitutes' scripts to also grant the buff for purchasing their services.

## OVERHAULS

[**Hunting Revolver Iron Sights - JSUE - Mojave Arsenal (GRA Merged) Patch**](https://github.com/Sigourn/iheartnewvegasrepository/blob/main/Hunting%20Revolver%20Iron%20Sights%20-%20JSUE%20-%20Mojave%20Arsenal%20(GRA%20Merged)%20Patch.7z)  
Compatibility patch for JSawyer Ultimate Edition - Mojave Arsenal Patch (GRA Merged).

[**Anatomic Perks**](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65648)  
Distributes the effect from the Living Anatomy perk to see the target's HP and DT, so that specific perks grant this bonus only against specific enemies.
Or, just take the Here and Now perk...

### Generating LOD

Assuming you use a different mod setup than the one recommended in the guide, you will have to generate LOD yourself.

- Run **FNVLODGen** in MO2.
- Right click on the list of worldspaces, and click **Select All**. Uncheck **FreesideFortWorld "Old Mormon Fort"**.
- Click **Generate**. The process will take some time.
- After the **LOD Generator: finished (you can close this application now)** message appears, close the program.

> ⚠️ Having too many LOD mods installed can cause **FNVLODGen** to fail at generating LOD appropriately. At the moment, the only scenario where I've found this to happen is at the Old Mormon Fort. Hence why are generating its LOD separate from the rest of the worldspaces.

- Now disable the following mods:
  - **LOD Additions and Improvements**
  - **LOD Additions and Improvements YUP ESP Replacer**
  - **FNV LOD Supplementation**
  - **TCM's LOD Overhaul**
  - **Much Needed LOD**
- Run **FNVLODGen** in MO2.
- Right click on the list of worldspaces, and click **Select None**. Check **FreesideFortWorld "Old Mormon Fort"**.
- Click **Generate**. The process will take some time.
- After the **LOD Generator: finished (you can close this application now)** message appears, close the program.

> ⚠️ Remember to re-enable the disabled LOD mods.

Now all that's left is to install our generated LOD.

- Navigate to your **Fallout New Vegas Mods\FNVLODGen Output** folder, and make an archive out of the **textures** and **meshes** folder. Name it **FNVLODGen Output**.
- Install **FNVLODGen Output** with MO2.

### MCM config

The following settings need to be configured after you've already started a new save, using the in-game **Mod Configuration** option.

**Enhanced Vision**:
- Set **Vision mode hotkey** to **N**.

**RAD**:
- Enable **Hardcore**.
- Enable **Alternate**.
- Enable **Incremental**.
- Enable **JSawyer Incremental**.

> ℹ️ Sleep deprivation affects max AP; makes all needs affect max AP, with sleep deprivation setting in later than hunger and thirst; makes needs affect max AP at rates similar to how needs cause stat penalties; makes the former setting follow JSawyer's stat penalties progression.

# MOD KEYBINDINGS

This is a handy reference table which will hopefully help you have a better idea of what new hotkeys are available to you, having followed this guide from beginning to end.

Key | Function | Added by
------------ | ------------- | -------------
X | Melee weapon bash | B42 Melee Bash
N | Enable enhanced vision/scroll through vision modes | Enhanced Vision
