# PREAMBLE

## Disclaimer

The guide presented here assumes you have already followed all instructions found in the setup page, and are familiar with Mod Organizer 2, which we will be using to install the mods in this document. Please abstain from using this guide until you've correctly set up Fallout: New Vegas and the recommended tools.

### Creating a separator

Separators allow you to neatly separate installed mods in Mod Organizer 2 for ease of viewing. These can be created and then moved around in the left pane to place them where you want them to be.

- Right click on the empty space on the left pane, below **Overwrite**, and click **Create Separator**.
- Name your separator and click **OK**.

I suggest creating a separator for DLC as well as each mod category we will be installing. Separators can be collapsed to keep your mod list clean and tidy.

- Right click on the list of worldspaces, and click **Select All**.
- Click **Generate**. The process will take some time.
- After the **LOD Generator: finished (you can close this application now)** message appears, close the program.

- Install **FNVLODGen Output** with MO2.
