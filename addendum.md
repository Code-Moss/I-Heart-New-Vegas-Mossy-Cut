It includes optional mods that are not present in **Main** for the sake of streamlining. Feel free to follow this guide in parallel to the main document, or, if you wish, follow it after finishing the main document. The correct mod order and load order, as well as slightly different **Finishing touches** instructions will be found at the end of this guide.
