## Acknowledgments

I want to thank Qolore7 of [**Viva New Vegas**](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/index.html) fame for all his hard work. Quite a bit of this guide comes from Viva New Vegas and previous iterations of it.

## About

**Left My ♥ In New Vegas** (a.k.a. **I ♥ New Vegas**) is a modular modding guide for **Fallout: New Vegas**. **I♥NV** is a highly compatible, highly stable, vanilla-friendly game focused on enhanced gameplay and a vanilla+ aesthetic. This means the guide avoids big gameplay, NPC, and town overhauls, as well as the hundreds of texture and mesh replacers that New Vegas players tend to install.

This guide is split in two sections:

- [**Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/iheartnewvegas/blob/main/setup.md). Includes setting up utilities and tools, as well as Mod Organizer 2. This section will be useful to anyone deciding to get into Fallout: New Vegas.
- [**Main**](https://github.com/Sigourn/iheartnewvegas/blob/main/main.md). Includes all mods we will be installing, including instructions for mod and load order, conflict resolution, configuration, and LOD generation. Mods are grouped by categories, and each category has an Optional section if you wish to install even more mods (however, the most important will have already been covered).

I've worked on this modlist for a few years already, but only recently decided to make a guide out of it. All I ask in return is your patience when it comes to following instructions. If I took the time to write them, you *should* take the time to read them.

## My setup

When installing all mods in this guide, as well as the recommended shaders, my framerate ranges anywhere from 30fps (at worst) to 60fps. For reference, here is a my setup.

System | My Specs
------------ | -------------
Operative System | Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit
CPU | Intel Core i5 4440
RAM | 8GB
Graphics | 1GB ATI AMD Radeon HD 7700 Series

Monitor | Samsung 24" 1080p @ 60Hz

## Frequently asked questions

### Is this guide compatible with A World of Pain/Strip Open/Freeside Open?

My guess is no. At any rate, I wouldn't bother with those mods unless you enjoy conflict solving.

### Is this mod compatible with I♥NV?

I can only try to give an educated guess. At the end of the day, there's no substitute for reading a mod's description and checking for compatibility in **FNVEdit**. 

### How many plugins and mods are there?

I tried to keep the amount of recommended mods relatively short and to the point. There are roughly 90 recommended (a.k.a. "essential") mods and 80 plugins total. Including the Optional mods takes the count to roughly 145 mods and 120 plugins total.

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

Roughly 6GB.

### How much time will it take me to install all mods?

Depends on how thorough you are about it. It shouldn't take you longer than five hours to set everything up, including optional mods.

### How often is the guide updated?

I♥NV is regularly updated as I find new mods to install, old mods that I consider are no longer worth the trouble of installing them, and bugs to fix or issues to sort out.

### Is there a Wabbajack installer for the guide available?

No. I already have enough questions asked because users installed a mod without reading what it did. I don't those questions to increase tenfold by providing an automated installer.

### Do you have a Patreon I can contribute to?

No.
