## Acknowledgments

I want to thank all users who have supported my [**Morrowind Sharp**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/blob/master/readme.md) modding guide. Their feedback, criticisms and insights have all been very valuable to me.

## Disclaimer

This is *not* a modding guide for beginners. If you've never played Fallout: New Vegas before, I recommend following the [**Viva New Vegas**](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/) modding guide. It has a fraction of the mods present here, and will take you considerably less time to follow and install appropriately.

## About

**I Heart New Vegas** is a modular modding guide for **Fallout: New Vegas**. It addresses a number of significant issues with the game:

- Bugs and stability: includes all major bug fixes released for the game so far, and a handful of minor, purist bug fixes that are entirely optional.
- Consolized user interface: improved readability and functionality, ironed out inconsistencies between carried over and new assets.
- Poorly implemented DLC: reworked implementation, GRA items available as loot and expansions delayed.
- Poor gunplay: new mechanics and improved animations, better visuals and sounds for a more satisfying experience.
- Unexisting difficulty: using JSawyer Ultimate Edition as a base to rebalance the game for a more hardcore experience, and other mods to improve NPC AI and mechanics, more dangerous radiation, decreased loot, harsher economy, less absurd repair system, less OP companions, and more.
- Empty world: restored content, new NPC and creature spawns.
- Potato characters: lore-friendly overhaul of NPCs that makes them look less like mutated Play-Doh and more like actual people.
- Disgusting piss filter and disappointing city of New Vegas: new lighting, improved Strip and LOD to experience the Mojave in all its glory.

What this guide doesn't do:

- Address every single micro-issue in the game: no game is perfect and all of them have flaws, yet we still enjoy them. My intention is to fix or at least address the most glaring ones, those that are a problem in the moment to moment experience.
- Add new features no one asked for: there are many gameplay mods out there, but the amount of them that actually try to fix issues with the existing game are in the minority. If you want to build your own settlement or robot army, look someplace else.
- Nitpick over individual meshes or textures: unless it's an actual fix, this guide won't bother. And even then, it probably won't bother either.
- Improve the meshes and textures of everything I can: this alone can add another 50 or 100 mods to any install, and inconsistency will sooner than later rear its ugly head.

I've worked on this modlist for a few years already, but only recently decided to make a guide out of it. All I ask in return is your patience when it comes to following instructions. If I took the time to write them, you *should* take the time to read them.

## Frequently asked questions

### How many plugins and mods are there?

There are 200 mods and 150 plugins total.

Unfortunately a lot of patching is required since many mods do not include fixes from the unofficial patch and conflicts between mods are a common occurrence, drastically increasing the amount oF plugins required to solve issues.

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

Roughly 13GB.

### How often is the guide updated?

I Heart New Vegas is regularly updated as I find new mods to install, old mods that I consider are no longer worth the trouble of installing them, and bugs to fix or issues to sort out.

### Is this guide compatible with A World of Pain/Strip Open/Freeside Open?

My guess is no. At any rate, I wouldn't bother with those mods unless you enjoy conflict solving, or breaking your save on uninstallation.

### Is (X) mod compatible with I Heart New Vegas?

I can only try to give an educated guess. At the end of the day, there's no substitute for reading a mod's description and checking for compatibility in **FNVEdit**. 

### Do you have a Patreon I can contribute to?

No. I'm always open to be given a game as a gift from my [**GOG Wishlist**](https://www.gog.com/u/Lucas9/wishlist), though. Argentina charges an extra 80% on purchasing foreign products, so you can imagine it adds up over time (if not discourages such purchases altogether).
