## Acknowledgments

I want to thank Qolore7 of [**Viva New Vegas**](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/index.html) fame for all his hard work. Quite a bit of this guide comes from Viva New Vegas and previous iterations of it.

## About

**Left My Heart In New Vegas** is a modular modding guide for **Fallout: New Vegas**. The end result is a highly compatible, highly stable, vanilla-friendly game focused on enhanced gameplay and a vanilla+ aesthetic. This means the guide avoids big gameplay, NPC, and town overhauls, as well as the hundreds of texture and mesh replacers that New Vegas players tend to install.

This guide is split in two sections:

- [**Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/iheartnewvegas/blob/main/setup.md). Includes setting up utilities and tools, as well as Mod Organizer 2. This section will be useful to anyone deciding to get into Fallout: New Vegas.
- [**Main**](https://github.com/Sigourn/iheartnewvegas/blob/main/main.md). Includes all mods we will be installing, including instructions for mod and load order, conflict resolution, configuration, and LOD generation.

I've worked on this modlist for a few years already, but only recently decided to make a guide out of it. All I ask in return is your patience when it comes to following instructions. If I took the time to write them, you *should* take the time to read them.

## My setup

When installing all mods in this guide, as well as the recommended shaders, my framerate ranges anywhere from 30fps (at worst) to 60fps. For reference, here is a my setup.

## Frequently asked questions

### What are the key differences between this guide and Viva New Vegas?

Scope and hand-holdiness. My guide is much bigger. It also demands more from its users. My guide lacks no major instructions, however, it is the user that needs to follow them to the letter. If you decide to skip them, it's on you. Expect no support from me.

### Is this guide compatible with A World of Pain/Strip Open/Freeside Open?

My guess is no. At any rate, I wouldn't bother with those mods unless you enjoy conflict solving.

### Is this mod compatible with the guide?

I can only try to give an educated guess. At the end of the day, there's no substitute for reading a mod's description and checking for compatibility in **FNVEdit**. 

### How many plugins and mods are there?

There are roughly 260 mods and 155 plugins total, including NVSE plugins, patches, and ESP replacers.

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

Roughly 6GB.

### How much time will it take me to install all mods?

Depends on how thorough you are about it. It shouldn't take you longer than five hours to set everything up, including optional mods.

### How often is the guide updated?

It is regularly updated as I find new mods to install, old mods that I consider are no longer worth the trouble of installing them, and bugs to fix or issues to sort out.

### Is there a Wabbajack installer for the guide available?

No. I already have enough questions asked because users installed a mod without reading what it did. I don't those questions to increase tenfold by providing an automated installer.

### Do you have a Patreon I can contribute to?

No.
