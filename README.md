> A personal modlist using Sigourns *"LEFT MY HEART IN NEW VEGAS"* as a base, with some extra mods and setups I **personally** use. NOT FOR FIRST TIME PLAYERS.

## Disclaimer

If you've never played Fallout: New Vegas before, I recommend following the [**Viva New Vegas**](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/) modding guide. It has a fraction of the mods present here, and will take you considerably less time to follow and install appropriately.

Also, feel free to post any issues and point out where I can make improvements. Your feedback is greatly appreciated.

## About

**MAXIMUM New Vegas** is a modular modding guide for **Fallout: New Vegas**. It addresses a number of significant issues with the game:

- Bugs and stability: includes all major bug fixes released for the game so far, and a handful of minor, purist bug fixes that are entirely optional.
- Consolized user interface: improved readability and functionality, ironed out inconsistencies between carried over and new assets.
- Poorly implemented DLC: reworked implementation, GRA items available as loot and expansions delayed.
- Poor gunplay: new mechanics and improved animations more satisfying experience.
- Unexisting difficulty: using JSawyer Ultimate Edition as a base to rebalance the game for a more hardcore experience, and other mods to improve NPC AI and mechanics, more dangerous radiation, decreased loot, harsher economy, less absurd repair system, less OP companions, and more.
- Empty world: restored content, new NPC and creature spawns.
- Potato characters: lore-friendly overhaul of NPCs that makes them look less like mutated Play-Doh and more like actual people.
- Disgusting piss filter and disappointing city of New Vegas: new lighting, improved Strip and LOD to experience the Mojave in all its glory.

What this guide **doesn't** do:

- Address every single micro-issue in the game: no game is perfect and all of them have flaws, yet we still enjoy them. My intention is to fix or at least address the most glaring ones, those that are a problem in the moment to moment experience.
- Nitpick over individual meshes or textures: unless it's an actual fix, this guide won't bother. And even then, it probably won't bother either.
- Improve the meshes and textures of everything I can: this alone can add another 50 or 100 mods to any install, and inconsistency will sooner than later rear its ugly head.

Sigourn: _"I've worked on this modlist for a few years already, but only recently decided to make a guide out of it. All I ask in return is your patience when it comes to following instructions. If I took the time to write them, you *should* take the time to read them."_
