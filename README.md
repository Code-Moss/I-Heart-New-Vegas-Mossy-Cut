I want to thank Qolore7 of [**Viva New Vegas**](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/index.html) fame for all his hard work. Quite a bit of this guide comes from Viva New Vegas and previous iterations of it.

## About

**Left My Heart In New Vegas** is a modular modding guide for **Fallout: New Vegas**. It addresses a number of significant issues with the game:

- Bugs and stability: includes all major bug fixes released for the game so far, and a handful of minor, purist bug fixes that are entirely optional.
- Consolized user interface: improved readability and functionality, ironed out inconsistencies between carried over and new assets.
- Poorly implemented DLC: reworked implementation, GRA items available as loot and expansions delayed.
- Poor gunplay: new mechanics and improved animations, better visuals and sounds for a more satisfying experience.
- Unexisting difficulty: using JSawyer Ultimate Edition as a base to rebalance the game for a more hardcore experience, and other mods to improve NPC AI and mechanics, more dangerous radiation, decreased loot, harsher economy, less absurd repair system, less OP companions, and more.
- Empty world: restored content, new NPC and creature spawns.
- Potato characters: lore-friendly overhaul of NPCs that makes them look less like mutated Play-Doh and more like actual people.
- Disgusting piss filter and disappointing city of New Vegas: new lighting, improved Strip and LOD to experience the Mojave in all its glory.

This guide is split in two sections:

- [**Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/iheartnewvegas/blob/main/setup.md). Includes setting up utilities and tools, as well as Mod Organizer 2. This section will be useful to anyone deciding to get into Fallout: New Vegas.
- [**Main**](https://github.com/Sigourn/iheartnewvegas/blob/main/main.md). Includes all mods we will be installing, including instructions for mod and load order, conflict resolution, configuration, and LOD generation.

I've worked on this modlist for a few years already, but only recently decided to make a guide out of it. All I ask in return is your patience when it comes to following instructions. If I took the time to write them, you *should* take the time to read them.

## My setup

## Frequently asked questions

### What are the key differences between this guide and Viva New Vegas?

Scope and hand-holdiness. My guide is much bigger. It also demands more from its users. My guide lacks no major instructions, however, it is the user that needs to follow them to the letter. If you decide to skip them, it's on you. Expect no support from me.

### Is this guide compatible with A World of Pain/Strip Open/Freeside Open?

My guess is no. At any rate, I wouldn't bother with those mods unless you enjoy conflict solving.

### Is this mod compatible with the guide?

I can only try to give an educated guess. At the end of the day, there's no substitute for reading a mod's description and checking for compatibility in **FNVEdit**. 

### How many plugins and mods are there?

There are roughly 120 mods and 100 plugins total.

Unfortunately a lot of patching is required since many mods do not include fixes from the unofficial patch and conflicts between mods are a common occurrence, drastically increasing the amount oF plugins required to solve issues.

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

Roughly 6GB.

### How much time will it take me to install all mods?

Depends on how thorough you are about it. It shouldn't take you longer than four hours to set everything up, including the optional (i.e. non-starred) mods.

### How often is the guide updated?

It is regularly updated as I find new mods to install, old mods that I consider are no longer worth the trouble of installing them, and bugs to fix or issues to sort out.

### Is there a Wabbajack installer for the guide available?

No. I already have enough questions asked because users installed a mod without reading what it did. I don't those questions to increase tenfold by providing an automated installer.

### Do you have a Patreon I can contribute to?

No.
